      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a self-taught full-stack developer based in South Africa, building practical and modern solutions for real-world problems.
        With a strong background in automation, crypto integration, and bot development, I help small businesses and individuals turn ideas into powerful digital tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        From web apps to backend logic and bots ‚Äî every project I take on is handled with efficiency, clarity, and a no-fluff mindset.
        I don't just build websites; I build scalable tools that move with your business.
