      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a self-taught full-stack developer based in South Africa, focused on building fast, clean, and reliable digital tools.
        My work blends backend logic, automation, integration, and front-end clarity — tailored for real-world use.
      </p>
      <p>
        I collaborate with startups, solo founders, and small businesses to deliver modern, efficient solutions that do more than just look good.
        Every build is designed to solve problems, save time, and scale as you grow.
      </p>

      <h2>Tailored for Small Business</h2>
      <p>
        FLOW-NET helps bakeries, restaurants, and local shops automate routine tasks and streamline communication.
        From Telegram-based ordering bots to simple admin dashboards, I build practical tools that support your workflow — not slow it down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're running a pizza shop or launching a new service, I can build digital systems that fit your pace and budget.

      <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
      <p>
        You work directly with the developer — no middlemen, no fluff. I focus on clean logic, fast builds, and transparent communication. 
        My goal is to deliver tools that just work — quietly powering your business in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t just build websites — I build solutions that evolve with your needs.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Need a custom landing page? A chatbot that handles orders? Or a full backend-connected system?
        I’ll design it, build it, test it — and get it live.
